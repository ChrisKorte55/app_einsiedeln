  "alltagImKlosterIntro" : "People often ask us what a typical day in the life of a monk looks like, especially when they visit our monastery. The daily routine itself is easy to describe, but its deeper meaning can only be understood by living it. Over time, it becomes clear: it's about something far greater, an encounter with God.",

  "historyPageIntro" : "In its over thousand-year history, the monastery reflects the history of the Church and society. It shows that our monastery is not an island, but is connected in many ways to its environment. Flourishing and decline, idealism and decadence, holiness and sin, light and shadow alternate through the centuries. Yet, what began in the 9th century with Saint Meinrad has borne fruit in many ways and has become a blessing to countless people. Thus, our monastic community in the 21st century can build upon a solid foundation and feels privileged to continue writing the story of the monastery and pilgrimage site.",
