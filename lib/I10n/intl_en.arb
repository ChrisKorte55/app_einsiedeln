  "alltagImKlosterIntro" : "People often ask us what a typical day in the life of a monk looks like, especially when they visit our monastery. The daily routine itself is easy to describe, but its deeper meaning can only be understood by living it. Over time, it becomes clear: it's about something far greater, an encounter with God.",

  "historyPage" : "Monastery History",
  "historyPageIntro" : "In its over thousand-year history, the monastery reflects the history of the Church and society. It shows that our monastery is not an island, but is connected in many ways to its environment. Flourishing and decline, idealism and decadence, holiness and sin, light and shadow alternate through the centuries. Yet, what began in the 9th century with Saint Meinrad has borne fruit in many ways and has become a blessing to countless people. Thus, our monastic community in the 21st century can build upon a solid foundation and feels privileged to continue writing the story of the monastery and pilgrimage site.",
  
  "wallfahrt" : "Pilgrimage",
  "wallfahrtIntro" : "We monks of Einsiedeln Abbey are entrusted with the pilgrimage to Our Lady of Einsiedeln. The Benedictine Abbey and Marian pilgrimage form a unique combination in Einsiedeln. Together with our staff, we strive to create a place here where encounters are possible—with God, with people, and with oneself.",
  "wallfahrtHistory" : "Einsiedeln is not a pilgrimage site based on a Marian apparition. Einsiedeln is a place of pilgrimage with a long tradition—a very long tradition with a strong monastic influence. In Einsiedeln, the monastery and the pilgrimage form a unique symbiosis, turning the sanctuary of the Mother of God in the heart of Switzerland into a Benedictine pilgrimage site. The history of pilgrimage in Einsiedeln begins with the simple cell of Saint Meinrad (+861), and over the centuries, it has made Einsiedeln the most important Marian pilgrimage site in Switzerland. The pilgrimage in the classical sense certainly dates back to the 12th century in Einsiedeln. Early written records from the early 14th century casually mention pilgrimages to Einsiedeln and also indicate that they were quite significant.",

  "benediktiner" : "Benedictines",
  "benediktinerIntro" : "We monks at Einsiedeln Abbey are Benedictines: We follow the monastic rule of Saint Benedict of Nursia. For Saint Benedict (480-547), the life of a monk is a search for God in the footsteps of Jesus, guided by the Gospel. The life of us Einsiedeln Benedictines unfolds in the rhythm of prayer, reading, work, and silence.",
  "benediktinerPar1" : "Benedict writes in his rule that nothing is to be preferred over the service of God. Therefore, the communal celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours and the Eucharist, along with scripture reading and personal prayer, form the core of our lives. In addition, we monks work in various areas of the monastery.",
  "benediktinerPar2" : "Since its founding in 934, the rule of Saint Benedict has shaped life at Einsiedeln Abbey. This is a long tradition that we gratefully maintain and translate into today.",
  "benediktinerPar3" : "The Rule of Benedict is, in a sense, the guiding principle of our monastery. The 73 chapters, written 1500 years ago, can no longer answer all the questions of a 21st-century monastery. Nevertheless, we can find answers to the questions and challenges of today in the spirit of Saint Benedict and his rule. Furthermore, the Rule of Benedict outlines an ideal of monastic life that is still relevant today.",
  "benediktinerPar4" : "Thus, we are convinced that it is still worthwhile to follow the path as a Benedictine monk at Einsiedeln Abbey today."
